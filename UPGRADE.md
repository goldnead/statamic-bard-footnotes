# Upgrading 1.x to 2.0

2.0 is a different product, not a drop-in: footnotes move out of a grid + typed `[1]` markers
into the Bard text itself. There is no automatic migration — the sources' wording never existed
in a machine-readable link to the markers.

## Requirements

2.0 needs Statamic 6 and PHP 8.2. On Statamic 5, stay on the `1.x` branch; it keeps the grid and
marker workflow and remains maintained for it.

## What disappears

- The `sources` grid fieldset (`bard-footnotes::sources`) and the blueprint import of it.
- The `{{ | footnotes }}` modifier and `Footnotes::render()` / `renderSets()` / `renderValue()`.

## Manual migration

1. Add `footnote` to the Bard field's `buttons` in your blueprint (see the README).
2. Remove the `sources` import from the blueprint.
3. For each entry: re-create every footnote at its `[n]` marker with the toolbar button, using
   row *n* of the old grid as the source, then delete the marker. The live superscript number
   replaces it.
4. Adjust the template (below), then drop the old `sources` field data.

## Templates

Before:

```antlers
{{ article | footnotes(sources) }}
{{ footnotes :sources="sources" :content="article" }}
```

After:

```antlers
{{ article }}
{{ footnotes field="article" }}
```

The tag now takes the field's handle via `field` (its raw value is read from the template
context — a `:content` binding would arrive as already-rendered HTML). In the pair loop,
`cited` is gone: every listed source is cited by definition.

## The empty-field warning

A Bard document containing footnote nodes needs this addon registered — for rendering **and**
for the CP. With the addon uninstalled or disabled, a Bard field holding footnotes loads
**empty** in the CP, and the next save destroys the value. The same applies to downgrade-back-to-1.x:
the 1.x code does not know the `footnote` node either. Migrate the content away before removing
the addon on any site.
